                <p class="desc">Big Data Learning Analytics (BDLA) deals with the use and implementation of
                    big data techniques and tools in learning design and exploration in learning context. Today, in the
                    time of creation of large numbers of digital learning platforms, virtual classrooms and online tests
                    and assessments, educational institutions continually produce large amount of data. Such records
                    consist of records of student performance, notes of their interactions, course relevant information
                    and records of feedback loops. BDLA uses these datasets to get best predictions of students’
                    behavior, activity and their performance. The greatest strength in BDLA therefore, is in its noble
                    capacity and capability to extract value from big, varied, complex data within velocity so as to
                    deliver executive decisions that are otherwise beyond conventional analytical techniques. BDLA sheds
                    light on patterns and relationships which remain unnoticed and can enhance pattern of </p>
